# Challenge-7-ETF_Analyzer
In this Challenge, I am building a financial database and web application by using SQL, Python, and the Voil√† library to analyze the performance of a hypothetical fintech ETF. I'll complete the analysis of a  fintech ETF that consists of four stocks: GOST, GS, PYPL, and SQ. Each stock has its own table in the etf.db database.

This program is divided into the following parts:
- Analyze a single asset in the ETF
- Optimize data access with advanced SQL queries
- Analyze the ETF portfolio
- Deploy the notebook as a web application

Here are the images of the web application appearence:<img width="1440" alt="Screen Shot 2022-08-08 at 3 37 26 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107383254/183502285-ff121a66-a0fd-453a-af26-111dff7190ca.png">
