# ETF_Analyzer
---
In this Challenge, I am building a financial database and web application by using SQL, Python, and the Voilà library to analyze the performance of a hypothetical fintech ETF. I'll complete the analysis of a fintech ETF that consists of four stocks: GOST, GS, PYPL, and SQ. Each stock has its own table in the etf.db database.

This application program is divided into the following parts:
- Analyze a single asset in the ETF
- Optimize data access with advanced SQL queries
- Analyze the ETF portfolio
- Deploy the notebook as a web application

## Technologies

This project leverages python 3.7 with SQLAlchemy and Voilà.


## Installation Guide

Before running the application first install the following dependencies.

```python
  pip install SQLAlchemy
  conda install -c conda-forge voila
```
